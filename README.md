Hello there!

I started my adventure with coding relatively recently (about 2 years ago). I'm an economist and I spent most of my professional activity on financial markets. My first projects were related to trade automation. Then I also became interested in data analysis. I code because it gives me pleasure to create things from scratch. In the future I intend to develop in this topic.
